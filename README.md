# 2ChoiceHashing

This project demonstrates a hash function using the 2-choice hashing technique for optimized data storage and retrieval. The 
repository contains source code, the dataset "Grocery_UPC_database.csv," and output analysis. See the code for implementation 
details and use the output reports for insights into hash function performance.
